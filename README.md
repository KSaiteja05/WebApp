# Project on AWS Cloud 
# My WebApp
This WebApp receives a pair of inputsâ€”an esteemed base and its corresponding exponent and effortlessly produces the result as the output.

# This amazing WebApp was built using AWS Cloud and front-end, employing different services to make it happen.
# AWS Services used:-
1. Amplify
2. Lambda
3. API Gateway
4. IAM
5. DynamoDB.
# Front-end Technologies used:-
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
# Actual Background Process:
When base and exponent is given as input it triggers the API Gateway which invokes the math function and the actual calculation is done in Lambda which has given some permission to the DyanamoDB from IAM and finally result is stored in DynamoDB and displays the output.
# The process to build WebApp is shown below:
# 1. Hosting the webpage in AWS Amplify.

# 2. Creating a function in AWS Lambda which does the math calculation.

After creating API Gateway the link below is used in webpage, whenever it has to trigger the API Gateway then it is called using this link.<br>

# 6. Giving DynamoDB permission in IAM through Lambda Configuration.

While giving the permissions ARN link(given below) should be given in JSON file which is the reference of DynamoDB <br>
